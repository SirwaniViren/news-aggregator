# news_aggregator
## Introduction
This is a side project which I am using to practice the Django framework and to some degree BeautifulSoup. News articles are scraped off of the BBC and then displayed in the site, i.e. the aggregator. I know this is a redundant, but I still want to see what I can achieve with the framework.
## Getting Started
First clone repository from Github and switch to the new directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/SirwaniViren/news_aggregator.git
cd news_aggregator
```
Activate the virtualenv for your project.

Apply migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```
Run the Server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
